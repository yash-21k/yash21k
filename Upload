Question Note: The main class name must be "Solution" Arya is attempting to solve a math problem. In this problem, she is given a tree with N nodes, indexed from 1 to N where the root node is indexed as 1. Each node of the tree has a defined value. She wants to trace a path from one leaf to another leaf in such a way that will award her the maximum score for that path. The score of a path is defined. as the product of node values along the path. Write an algorithm to find the maximum possible score. Input The first line of the input consists of an integer num, representing the number of nodes in the tree (N). The second line consists N space-separated integers representing the value of each node in the tree. The third line consists of two space-separated integers - numEdges and numNodes, representing the number of edges (E) and the number of nodes forming an edge (where V2 always), respectively. The next E lines consist of two space-separated integers - start and end, representing the indices of the starting node and ending node of an edge of the tree. Output Print an integer representing the maximum possible score. Constraints 1 s num≤ 103 -103≤val ≤ 103; where val is the value of a node numEdges = num-1 numNodes 2 Example Input: 4 -1232 32 12 13 34 Output: -12 in java
