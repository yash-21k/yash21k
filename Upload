Subject: Request to Postpone Certification Assessment

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

The deadline for taking up the assessment—which needs to be cleared in just one attempt—is by next week. At the moment, I’m tied up with the release scheduled for 9th August 2025, including FVT and some other priority tasks.

Given the current workload, it’s a bit difficult for me to take out time to prepare properly and appear for the certification before the deadline.

I’d really appreciate it if this certification could either be postponed or excluded in my case for now.

Thanks for your understanding.
