Subject: Challenges in Swift GPI-Outbound Asset Development

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you are doing well. As we continue developing the Swift GPI-Outbound asset, we have encountered some challenges that we would like to bring to your attention for resolution:

1. Baseline Documentation of BDE Mapping
Currently, we are referring to three different sheets for mapping BDEs against our data model. A consolidated and structured baseline document would help streamline this process.


2. Illustration of Mapping with an Example
It would be helpful to have an illustration showcasing how values will be displayed or passed to our database. For instance, in the case of the FX Rate field, the provided logic states that it should be "FX Rate target currency/source currency." While this is documented as a formula, our discussion yesterday indicated that it should be a concatenation. Clarification on such aspects would be beneficial.


3. Sample Messages
The sample messages provided for development differ from those in production, with some fields missing. Adding new fields on the go in our classes is causing confusion. Additionally, we request that the Ingestion team be kept in sync so they can ingest the relevant fields accordingly.


4. Fields with Array Values
In the production sample message, some fields contain three amount values, but the mapping sheet does not specify which one to use. Guidance on this would help ensure data consistency.



We would appreciate your support in addressing these issues at the earliest. Please let us know a convenient time to discuss this further.

Best regards,
