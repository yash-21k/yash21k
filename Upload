Subject: Challenges Faced During Code Deployment

Dear @Apoon,

I hope you are doing well.

I am reaching out to bring to your attention some significant challenges our team is facing during code deployment, which are consuming a considerable amount of time. Below are the key issues:

1. Inability to Run Parallel Jobs: Running multiple jobs simultaneously leads to pipeline failures, preventing us from leveraging parallel execution.


2. Long Build Times: Each pipeline takes an average of 25 minutes to build. When a pipeline fails, re-running it takes another 25 minutes, significantly impacting efficiency.


3. Jenkins Master Branch Visibility Issue: We frequently encounter situations where our main master branch is not visible in Jenkins, causing delays in the deployment process.



The affected jobs include Config, Transformer, Processor-6 jobs, Data Lookup, and DeDup-6 jobs.

We would appreciate any guidance or solutions to help streamline the deployment process. Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
