I have reviewed the GPI and GMG data flow jobs.

GPI: Only two messages were received, both of which had unsupported message types. As a result, they were blocked by our deduplication data flow job. We expect GPI real-time data to start flowing once the business users begin working with real-time inputs.

GMG: We are successfully processing GB and FR messages. These messages are being persisted in both BigQuery and BigTable.
