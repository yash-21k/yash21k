Subject: Request for Postponement of Certification Assessment

Hi [Approver's Name],

As part of the ISGCU mandate, I understand there is a requirement to complete a certification assessment, which must be cleared in a single attempt by next week.

However, I am currently preoccupied with the upcoming release scheduled for 09th August 2025, along with FVT and other high-priority tasks. Given the workload, it is quite difficult for me to spare time to prepare and appear for the assessment within the current deadline.

I kindly request you to consider excluding me from this certification cycle or allowing a postponement, if possible.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
