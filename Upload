Sure! Here's a polished version of your message:

I attempted to replicate this issue in my local environment and found two key points:

1. The message did not generate a valid row key because it was converted to PACS.009 due to the presence of the /ACC/RTN/ keyword in the MT payload.


2. In the gpirt table, the endToEndId was null, which is required for a PACS.009 message, and as a result, the message was not processed.

Let me know if you'd like it to sound more formal or technical.
