Our transformer creates a list where message-related objects are stored in the same order they are added.

Normally, only one object is present in the list. This first object represents the main message, and its system name is AMH.

The RawPayload logic was written to pick the last object from the list using (list size − 1). Since there was only one object earlier, this always pointed to the main message correctly.

What changed:

For dummy events, we now add one more object to the list.

So the list now contains:

First object → Main message (System Name: AMH)

Second object → Dummy event (System Name: SWIFT GPI GCCT)

Because the RawPayload logic always selects the last object, it started picking the second (dummy event) object instead of the main message.

Result:The AMH RECEIVED_FROM_SWIFT payload was incorrectly tagged with the system name SWIFT GPI GCCT instead of AMH, since the system started reading the dummy event entry rather than the main message entry
